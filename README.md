## TERMS AND CONDITIONS

MIT license. In short: go nuts, but give credit where credit is due.

Please see the included LICENSE.txt for the legalese.

## INTRO
MUD (Multi-User Dungeon) games and their brethren like MUSH, MUX, MUCK, and MOO (look 'em up!) use various ANSI features to provide colors to clients. Sadly there aren't many libraries out there which allow advanced manipulation of such text which preserve the formatting already applied to it. This attempts to address this problem.

mudrich is built upon the existing library, [rich](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich), bringing in support for MXP and Pueblo and optimizing the project for MUDs. So, in order to use this library effectively, one must familiarize themselves with Rich. Rich is awesome, so be sure and do that soon.

## FEATURES
  * Everything Rich can do - at least, from when we forked it onwards. Seriously, check it out...
  * MXP / Pueblo Support.
  * Encodings library, containing fully-working examples for how to implement various ANSI systems used by existing games.
